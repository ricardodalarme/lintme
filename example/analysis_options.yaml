  # Dart Code Linter provides custom configurable rules.
  # The rules have a `kebab-case` naming instead of 
  # `snake_case` intentionally in order for you to identify,
  # whether the rule is from Dart Code Metrics or the standard analyzer.
  # All rules share basic configuration like `exclude` section,
  # but some also have a rule-specific one.
  # Not all rules are listed here, the full list can be found on our website: https://github.com/bancolombia/dart-code-linter/wiki/Rules
