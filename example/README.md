# Examples

Lintme is a static analysis tool and code from it is not expected to be used directly. Instead, it should be added as a dev dependency and installed [as described here](https://lintme.dev/docs/individuals/getting-started).

## Preferred way: plugin and CLI

To use Lintme as a plugin or a CLI, check out [this repository](https://github.com/ricardodalarme/lintme-example) with the example Flutter app. It covers Lintme setup and shows all commands output.

## Additional way: as a library

**Note:** usually you don't need to use Lintme directly.

Lintme can be used directly as a library, imported and called from your code. Continue with [this example](https://github.com/ricardodalarme/lintme-example/blob/main/lib_example/lib/main.dart) in order to get more details.

## Presets

Presets can be enabled with `extends` config, more details [can be found here](https://lintme.dev/docs/individuals/configuration/presets/).
